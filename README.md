# Bioinactivation FE

Bioinactivation FE is a user friendly interface to the functions for modelling microbial inactivation included in the bioinactivation package for R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bioinactivation/index.html). These include:

* Model fitting of isothermal experiments.
* Model fitting of non-isothermal experiments.
* Calculation of predictions for isothermal/non-isothermal profiles.
* Generation of prediction intervals.

The application can be accessed freely in the following link:
